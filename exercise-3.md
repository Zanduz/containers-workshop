# Exercise 3: Work with Docker Hub and inspect your local Docker environment

## Objective

Become familiar with image tags/versions and Docker Hub.

## Steps

1. Pull an image you have not yet worked with from the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com), e.g. [PostgresSQL](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/postgresql).
2. List all images in your local registry.
3. Pull a version of that image that is *not* the latest.
4. List all images in your local registry again. What do you see?
5. Remove the older version from your local registry again.
6. Tag the image you built in the previous exercise with a tag of your choice.
7. List all images in your local registry again. What do you see now?
